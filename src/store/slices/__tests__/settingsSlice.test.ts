/**
 * Settings Slice Test Documentation
 * 
 * This file contains test scenarios for the settings slice.
 * To implement actual tests, you would need to set up Jest:
 * 
 * 1. Install dependencies:
 *    npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
 * 
 * 2. Add jest.config.js:
 *    module.exports = {
 *      preset: 'ts-jest',
 *      testEnvironment: 'node',
 *      setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts']
 *    };
 * 
 * 3. Add to package.json scripts:
 *    "test": "jest",
 *    "test:watch": "jest --watch"
 */

// Test scenarios for Settings Slice:

/**
 * 1. Initial State Tests
 * - Should have default language as 'de'
 * - Should have default theme mode as 'system'
 * - Should have notifications enabled by default
 * - Should have all loading states as false
 * - Should have all error states as null
 */

/**
 * 2. Language Change Tests
 * - Should change language from 'de' to 'en' successfully
 * - Should change language from 'en' to 'de' successfully
 * - Should set loading state during language change
 * - Should handle language change errors gracefully
 * - Should clear language errors when requested
 */

/**
 * 3. Theme Change Tests
 * - Should change theme from 'system' to 'light'
 * - Should change theme from 'system' to 'dark'
 * - Should change theme back to 'system'
 * - Should set loading state during theme change
 * - Should handle theme change errors gracefully
 * - Should clear theme errors when requested
 */

/**
 * 4. Notification Tests
 * - Should toggle notifications from true to false
 * - Should toggle notifications from false to true
 * - Should request permissions when enabling notifications
 * - Should set loading state during notification toggle
 * - Should handle notification errors gracefully
 * - Should clear notification errors when requested
 */

/**
 * 5. Settings Initialization Tests
 * - Should initialize with current i18n language
 * - Should initialize with current notification permissions
 * - Should handle initialization errors gracefully
 */

/**
 * 6. Persistence Tests (Integration)
 * - Should persist language setting across app restarts
 * - Should persist theme setting across app restarts
 * - Should persist notification setting across app restarts
 */

/**
 * Example Test Implementation:
 * 
 * import { create } from 'zustand';
 * import { createSettingsSlice, SettingsSlice } from '../settingsSlice';
 * 
 * describe('SettingsSlice', () => {
 *   let store: ReturnType<typeof create<SettingsSlice>>;
 * 
 *   beforeEach(() => {
 *     store = create<SettingsSlice>()(createSettingsSlice);
 *   });
 * 
 *   test('should have correct initial state', () => {
 *     const state = store.getState();
 *     expect(state.language).toBe('de');
 *     expect(state.themeMode).toBe('system');
 *     expect(state.notifications).toBe(true);
 *   });
 * 
 *   test('should change language successfully', async () => {
 *     const { changeLanguage } = store.getState();
 *     await changeLanguage('en');
 *     expect(store.getState().language).toBe('en');
 *   });
 * });
 */

/**
 * Manual Testing Checklist:
 * 
 * □ Language switching works in settings screen
 * □ UI updates immediately when language changes
 * □ Language preference persists after app restart
 * □ Theme switching works (light/dark/system)
 * □ Theme changes are applied immediately
 * □ System theme follows device theme
 * □ Theme preference persists after app restart
 * □ Notification toggle works
 * □ Notification setting persists after app restart
 * □ Error states are handled gracefully
 * □ Loading states are shown during changes
 * □ Settings screen navigation works from profile
